# sql-with-python
I have employed Python exclusively for the purpose of establishing a database in PostgreSQL. Within this database framework, I crafted a table, populated it with pertinent values, and executed queries on said table to derive expeditious insights. Additionally, I devised a streamlined script to seamlessly execute all the aforementioned code. 

The dataset I utilized for this project pertains to information from coffee shops.
